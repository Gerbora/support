    While adding a variable in the title you can see a rendered preview with the current value of the variable. How
    variable is rendered depends on the <strong>variable display type</strong>. It may be a <strong>string</strong>,
    <strong>number</strong>, <strong>base </strong>or <strong>percent</strong>.
