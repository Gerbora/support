    For hobby projects 12 hours is more than enough. With 12 hours you can see what happened while you were sleeping.
    However, <strong>for</strong> most <strong>businesses 3 days is a must-have</strong>.

    There are many cases when people push updates on a Friday and everything seems ok but suddenly something crashes the
    server on a Saturday and on Monday Itâ€™s hard to tell what happened without the 3 days of logs because nobody reacted
    to notifications over the weekend.
</p>

<p>
    More than 3 days of logs is great to compare stats with previous days or weeks. When you deploy new performance
    updates, you must have statistics to measure the effectiveness of the update.

    So, at the end of the day it all depends on your needs and how important your server is. For businesses we recommend
    the Medium plan and for hobbyists - the free plan is enough.
