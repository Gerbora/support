<p>
    Variables are placeholders that represent particular values from the output of the command executed on your server.
</p>

<!--more-->

<p>
    In the data source configuration view, you can add, edit or remove variables. Each variable is associated with one
    cell in the table of parsed output.
</p>

<p>
    Double check the variable value source cell in the variable settings if:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>You changed the command</li>
    <li>The format of the command output changed</li>
    <li>Delimiters were updated that specify how to split the raw output into a table of data</li>
</ul>
