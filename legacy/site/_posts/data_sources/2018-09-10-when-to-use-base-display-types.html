<p>
    When you have numeric values to track and it needs to be divided by some base. You can also add some suffix next to
    the value. A good example is the <strong>size of bytes</strong>. If the command return bytes and you want to see
    Megabytes or Gigabytes, you have to use display type: <strong>base</strong>.

<p>
    Default options will have base defined as 1024 and it will have several options to convert bytes to <span
        class="t-code">KB</span>, <span class="t-code">MB</span>, <span class="t-code">GB</span>, <span class="t-code">TB</span>.
    You can delete any of these and replace it with what makes sense for you.
