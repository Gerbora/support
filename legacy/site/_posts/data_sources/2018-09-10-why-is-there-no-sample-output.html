    Just wait a few minutes and refresh the view. If Trafikito agent is installed on your server, data comes once per
    minute. So, it's best to wait a few minutes then check if new data is coming to the dashboard. If it is coming, you
    should see the sample output.

<p>
    If youâ€™ve waited a few minutes already but the data is still not there, then double check your command. You can
    always see what command is executing on your server by the selected alias.
</p>

<p>
    Try to copy and execute it on your server directly. If it works for you but Trafikito is still not getting the data,
    ensure that Trafikito agent has permission to execute this command.
