<p>
    When you edit a notification settings, click “<strong>Save notification</strong>” first to save any edits. Then
    click “<strong>Test</strong>”, it will make an API call just like it would during an event. You will not only test
    the action but you will also get results after the test is done.

    You can always see the last logs for any notification. it is useful to debug things when your custom action is not
    working as expected.
