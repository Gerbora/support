<p>
    Mass actions allow you to edit multiple notifications at once. To do it, follow these steps:
</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
    <li>Open the main menu on the top left [menu icon]</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Dashboard</strong></li>
    <li>In the servers list find the server you want to edit and click <strong>Open</strong> next to it</li>
    <li>On the top right click <strong>Settings</strong></li>
    <li>Use the Show button next to <strong>Notifications</strong> to show the notifications list.</li>
    <li>Use the checkbox before the notification name to <strong>select notifications</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>
    When one or more notifications are selected, mass actions will appear in front of the notifications list. These
    actions will update all the selected notifications at once.
