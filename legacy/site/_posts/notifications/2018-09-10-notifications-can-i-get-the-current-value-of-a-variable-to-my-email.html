<p>
    <strong>Yes</strong> you can. You can use any variable placeholders inside the body, URL or header value fields.
    Placeholders will be replaced with actual value on a fly. Below all configuration options for notifications, you
    will find all your variables from all data sources. Click on any to copy. Variables must be surrounded by pairs of
    curly braces like this: <span class="t-code">{% raw %}{{ram_used}}{% endraw %}</span>
