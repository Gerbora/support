    This is a 3 steps process which you can start here: <a href="https://trafikito.com/user/recover" target="_blank">Recover</a>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Enter your email which you used to register and click <strong>Request new password</strong>.</li>
    <li>You will <strong>get an email</strong> with a password <strong>recovery link</strong>. Click on it.</li>
    <li>You will <strong>get another email</strong> with a <strong>new password</strong>. Use it to login.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After completing the 2nd step, your old password will stop working and you will need to use the new random password
    that was sent during step 3.
