    Some logs may still be on our database or cached on our edges but eventually it will be deleted after the expiration
    dates. For example the free plan saves logs for 24 hours, paid plans for longer. API call logs are saved for 7
    days. Such logs will be deleted after it expires and will not be visible to any user when the server is deleted.
