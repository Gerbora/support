<p>
    Workspaces may have from 1 to 30 members. To add a new member you must have an admin role or owner role and you will
    need to add the personâ€™s email.
</p>

<!--more-->

<p>
    After adding the new member, she or he will get an invitation email with relevant
    details such as the workspace name and the inviter. If an email is not registered with Trafikito as yet, the user
    will be created and an invitation email will include a randomly generated password. To add a new member, follow
    these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the main menu on the top left [menu icon]</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Dashboard</strong></li>
    <li>On top of the servers list, you can see the name of the selected workspace. Click it to open more details</li>
    <li>On the top select the <strong>Members</strong> tab</li>
    <li>On the bottom of the active dialog enter the email to invite</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Add member</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>Note:</h4>

<p>
    The Free and start plans do not include role management; so a new user will automatically have an admin role.
    However, the Medium and Roarrr plans do include role management; so a new member will have a "member" role.
