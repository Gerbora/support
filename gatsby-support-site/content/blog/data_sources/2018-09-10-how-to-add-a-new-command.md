    <li>
        Edit this file: <span class="t-code">/opt/trafikito/available_commands.sh</span>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>If this file is not available, Trafikito agent is not installed yet or it is installed at a custom
                location
            </li>
        </ol>

<p>
    E.g. you want to execute <span class="t-code">top -bcn1</span> command. To add it, you can use:
</p>

<div class="t-code">trafikito_custom="top -bcn1"</div>
<br>

<p>
    After <strong>a minute or two</strong> you will find <span class="t-code">trafikito_custom</span> available in the
    data source edit views on the dashboard.
</p>

<h4>Note:</h4>
Make sure all commands have a <span class="t-code">trafikito_</span> prefix or it wonâ€™t work.
