    You can also delete several notifications at once. To do this, go to the notification list and check several
    notifications simultaneously by using the checkboxes in front of the notifications name that you wish to delete.
    After at least one notification is checked, mass action options will be revealed above the list. One of the option
    is to delete all selected notifications.
