&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You get more visibility. Free plan gives 24 hours while the paid plans may provide up to 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;With the paid plan you can add members to the workspace and manage roles&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;With the paid plans you can monitor more commands, set up more notification rules, monitor more servers, send
        bigger output per minute to Trafikito
