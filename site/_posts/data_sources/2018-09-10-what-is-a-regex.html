<p>
    Have you noticed that while splitting the output of the command into a table you can use something called
    <em>regex</em>? This means you can use regular expression syntax as the delimiter. This is a very powerful way to
    split by anything in the text.

<p>
    E.g. default delimiter to split the row into columns is <span class="t-code">[,]+</span> which is a regular
    expression. It means
</p>

<blockquote>split by sequence of space or comma characters. There may be one or more of these in a row.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>

<p>
    It will split text by any combination of spaces and commas. All these texts would be split into 3 columns
    with values “Foo” “bar” and “baz”:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="t-code">Foo bar baz</span></li>
    <li><span class="t-code">Foo bar baz</span></li>
    <li><span class="t-code">Foo , bar baz</span></li>
    <li><span class="t-code">Foo,bar,baz</span></li>
    <li><span class="t-code">Foo, bar, baz</span></li>
</ul>

    which is a tool to write and test regular expressions. Make sure to select JavaScript flavor on the left, in some
    cases, there is a slight difference.
