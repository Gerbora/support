    Trafikito gets command output from Linux machines as text. While you need to track some part of the text, e.g. you
    want to monitor an average load while using <span class="t-code">uptime</span> command.
</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is the sample output of an <span class="t-code">uptime</span> command:</p>


<div class="t-code">16:32:47 up 3 min, 1 user, load average: 2.3, 0.41, 0.19</div>
<br/>
<p>
    You want the <strong>chart</strong> displaying the current value of <span class="t-code">2.3</span> and the change
    over time. So you have to extract this number.
    You can do this by splitting the text into a table using delimiters.
</p>

<p>
    One delimiter is used to split the text into rows and then each row can have the custom delimiter to split it into
    columns.
</p>

<p>
    After its finished, you have a table and in some cells your required values. Every minute Trafikito gets new output,
    splits it into a table using the same delimiters and data is updated.
</p>

<h4>Note:</h4>

<p>
    By default Trafikito sets line delimiter to new line symbol, which is: <span class="t-code">\n</span> and row
    delimiter is regular expression <span class="t-code">[,]+</span>, which splits row into columns by one or more space
    or comma symbols which is what you need most of the time. You will notice that by default settings most of the time
    you will have data parsing done automatically.
</p>

<p>
    When you have a table with data you can create new variables and assign cells. Variables will always hold updated
    values of specific cells.
