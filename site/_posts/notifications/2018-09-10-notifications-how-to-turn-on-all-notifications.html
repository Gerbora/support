<p>
    In the notifications list you can select several notifications and turn them on all at once. This mass action will
    turn on selected notifications without modifying individual <em>when</em> cases. If the notification doesnâ€™t have
    any <em>when</em> cases or all cases are turned off individually - the notification will do nothing.
