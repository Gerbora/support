    <li>
        <strong>Variable</strong> - you have to select an existing variable to track from data sources
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Range change</strong> - you have to select one of the range change events
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stay in range</strong> - defines how long a value has to stay in a new range before it triggers this
        when case
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wait before firing again</strong> - you can set if when cases should be fired several times and how long
        to wait before firing again.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Allow this to fire at any time</strong> - switch indicating if other “when” case must be fired on the
        same variable to fire again
    </li>
</ol>
