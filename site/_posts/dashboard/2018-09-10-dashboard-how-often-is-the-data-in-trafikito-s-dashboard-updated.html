    Trafikito’s dashboard data, including server list and single server views, are continuously being refreshed in the
    background. A data refresh is performed every 30 seconds.

<p>
    If a server is working as expected, new data will be available once per minute. You can leave the dedicated display
    view open and it will always show updated information.

<p>
    You can also refresh data manually by refreshing the page or by clicking [icon] icon on the top right.
