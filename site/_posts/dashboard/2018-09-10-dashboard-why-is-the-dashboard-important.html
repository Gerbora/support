    A dashboard is an essential part of Trafikito’s web interface. It shows the current status of your servers in
    addition to log information recorded over time.

<p>
    The dashboard is fully customizable and can be arranged in a way that suits your needs for free. You can add data
    sources to your server, parse the output of any command running on your server, extract variables and display them
    on the dashboard.
</p>

<p>
    You can select different display types for different data. The available display types are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>string</li>
    <li>number</li>
    <li>base</li>
    <li>percent</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can start monitoring the output of any command, change which data to monitor by going to current data sources,
    from there, you will be able to create, edit or remove variables that are visible in the charts and text boxes
    within the single server view. To learn more, browse this FAQ site or visit <a
