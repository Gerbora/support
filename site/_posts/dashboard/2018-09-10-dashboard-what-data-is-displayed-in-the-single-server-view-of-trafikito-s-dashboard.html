<p>
    A single view layout is fully customizable. It reports whatever makes sense in your case. During installation,
    Trafikito tries to retrieve the usage data of all basic resources, such as <span class="t-code">CPU</span>, <span
        class="t-code">RAM</span>, <span class="t-code">disk</span>, and <span class="t-code">average load</span>, this
    data will be used to generate an initial dashboard for you with some text boxes and charts showing the status and
    changes over time.

<p>
    To start monitoring the output of any command, open settings on the single server view and make changes to data
    sources. From there, you will be able to create, edit or remove variables that are visible in the charts and text
    boxes within the single server view.

<p>
    To make any changes, you must have an admin or owner role in an active workspace. All changes will be applied to all
    members of that particular workspace.
