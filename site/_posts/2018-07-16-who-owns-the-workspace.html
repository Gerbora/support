<p>
    When you register for the first time, an initial workspace is created for you and you are the owner of it. You can
    always see who is the owner of an active workspace.

    <li>On top of the servers list, you can see the name of the selected workspace. Click it to open more details</li>
    <li>On the top select <strong>Members</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Find the member with the role “owner” next to it. This member is an owner of the selected workspace.</li>
